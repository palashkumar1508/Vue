Vue.js is a popular JavaScript framework that allows developers to build reactive and dynamic web applications. One of its most powerful features is its lifecycle hooks. Lifecycle hooks are functions that get called at specific stages of a component's lifecycle, allowing developers to perform actions and manipulate data at those points.

There are eight lifecycle hooks in Vue.js, divided into four categories: creation, mounting, updating, and destruction. In this article, we will explain each hook and provide examples to illustrate their usage.

Creation Hooks
Creation hooks are called when a component is first created. They are useful for initializing data, setting up watchers, and other setup tasks.

beforeCreate
The beforeCreate hook is called before the component is created. At this point, the component's data and events have not been initialized, and the template has not been compiled. This hook is useful for setting up any data or services that the component needs before it is created.

Example:

export default {
  beforeCreate() {
    console.log('Component is about to be created');
  }
}
created
The created hook is called after the component is created. At this point, the component's data and events have been initialized, but the template has not been mounted to the DOM. This hook is useful for performing any initial setup tasks that require access to the component's data.

Example:

export default {
  created() {
    console.log('Component has been created');
  }
}

Mounting Hooks
Mounting hooks are called when a component is mounted to the DOM. They are useful for performing tasks that require access to the DOM, such as setting up event listeners or fetching data from an API.

beforeMount
The beforeMount hook is called before the component is mounted to the DOM. At this point, the component's template has been compiled, but it has not yet been added to the DOM. This hook is useful for performing any setup tasks that require access to the component's template.

Example:

export default {
  beforeMount() {
    console.log('Component is about to be mounted');
  }
}
mounted
The mounted hook is called after the component is mounted to the DOM. At this point, the component's template has been added to the DOM, and it is now visible to the user. This hook is useful for performing any tasks that require access to the DOM, such as setting up event listeners or fetching data from an API.

Example:

export default {
  mounted() {
    console.log('Component has been mounted');
  }
}
Updating Hooks
Updating hooks are called when a component's data changes. They are useful for performing tasks that need to be updated whenever the component's data changes.

beforeUpdate
The beforeUpdate hook is called before a component's data changes. At this point, the component's data has been updated, but the DOM has not yet been re-rendered. This hook is useful for performing any tasks that need to be updated before the DOM is re-rendered.

Example:

export default {
  beforeUpdate() {
    console.log('Component is about to be updated');
  }
}
updated
The updated hook is called after a component's data changes. At this point, the component's data has been updated, and the DOM has been re-rendered. This hook is useful for performing any tasks that need to be updated after the DOM has been re-rendered.

Example:

export default {
  updated() {
    console.log('Component has been updated');
  }
}
Destruction Hooks
Destruction hooks are called when a component is destroyed. They are useful for performing cleanup tasks, such as
