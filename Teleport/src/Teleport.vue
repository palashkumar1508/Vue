        <h3 class="text-white text-xl p-2">Teleport is a new feature introduced in Vue 3 that allows a component to be rendered in a different part of the DOM tree than its parent component, without losing its original state or event listeners. This is particularly useful when you want to render a component as a modal, dialog, or tooltip, that is detached from its parent component, but still needs to access the same data and methods.</h3>
